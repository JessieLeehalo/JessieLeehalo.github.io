I was busy on my new house these days, after several days of working, finally move in the new house yesterday.
But there is still many boxes that still unboxed.Never mind, I'll leave it there and tiny them up on when I am not that exhausted.

The  new house is really far away from where I am working as it takes me about one hour and half.
On the whole day, I was so tired for lacking sleeping.
Anyway,it is long distance but I am very satisfied with the new house.

Hope it gets well for the coming days.
